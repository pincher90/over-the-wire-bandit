# Level 2 â†’ Level 3
# -----------------
# Objective:
# The password is stored in a file called "--spaces in this filename--"
# located in the home directory.

# Connect to the server:
ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
# Enter password: 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx

# Once logged in:
# List the files in the home directory
ls -la

# Found file: '--spaces in this filename--'
# Issue:
# - Filenames starting with "--" are often treated as command options.
# - Spaces in the name split it into separate arguments.
# Fix:
# - Prefix with "./" to show it's a file in the current directory.
# - Escape the spaces with "\" so the shell reads the name as one argument.
cat ./--spaces\ in\ this\ filename--

# Output / Findings:
