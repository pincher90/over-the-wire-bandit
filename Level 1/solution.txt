# Level 1 â†’ Level 2
# -----------------
# Objective:
# Read the password from a file literally named "-" in the home directory.

# Connect to the server:
ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
# Enter password: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If

# Once logged in:
# List the files in the home directory
ls -la

# Found file: '-'
# Normally, "-" tells Linux commands to read what you type on the keyboard.
# But here "-" is the actual file name. To make "cat" treat it like a file,
# we give its path explicitly with "./-".
cat ./-

# Output / Findings:
