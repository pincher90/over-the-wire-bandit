# Over The Wire Bandit Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [OverTheWire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame.

## About
Bandit is a Linux wargame focused on shell fundamentals, file permissions, and problem-solving at the command line.
Working through it gave me a chance to reinforce core Linux skills while building the persistence needed to solve unfamiliar problems.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Strengthened practical Linux knowledge (`ls`, `grep`, `find`, `xxd`, `base64`, `tr`, etc.).
- Improved troubleshooting and systematic thinking.
- Learned to stick with problems no matter how long they took.
- Directly relevant to DevOps and security fundamentals.

## Repository Structure
Each folder contains my notes and solution for a specific level:

**Levels 0 â†’ 20**

## Next Steps
Continuing towards higher Bandit levels and other wargames (Narnia, Leviathan) to deepen Linux and security knowledge.
